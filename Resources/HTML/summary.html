		<p id="text">Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is quickly gaining in popularity as a safer and more effective means to diagnose and stage lung cancer.  While the initial cost of capital equipment and reimbursement concerns have been a deterrent for many facilities considering an EBUS program, it is important to note that the financial benefits of EBUS extend beyond the Pulmonary department alone. The EBUS program can often be a powerful downstream revenue generator for a hospital, with the EBUS case often serving as the patient's first point of entry into the hospital system. A significant percentage of EBUS patients may require additional services from the facility, creating an indirect revenue stream that originated within the Pulmonary department but benefits the facility as a whole.</p>
		<p id="text">EBUS is an essential tool for investigating lung disease and specifically lung cancer. It can also be a compelling business proposition for your facility. Ultimately, the introduction of EBUS at your facility will be a major addition to your existing Pulmonary portfolio, and will enable a higher level of care for the patients that you serve.</p>
		<p style="font-weight: 900; font-size:20px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">About EBUS</p>
		<p id="text">When a patient is being evaluated for potential lung cancer, one possible challenge is to determine proper staging.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) offers a less invasive alternative for sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes, as opposed to the more invasive surgical technique, known as mediastinoscopy. The Olympus EBUS system offers real-time imaging, allowing the physician to confirm the exact position of the needle in the lymph node during biopsy. Unlike conventional transbronchial needle aspiration or mediastinoscopy, EBUS-TBNA’s breakthrough combination of maximum reliability and minimum invasiveness has made it our biopsy method of choice for more accurate diagnosis and staging in the lung.</p>
		<p id="text">Technological improvements have facilitated an increase in accuracy and reliability of bronchoscopy procedures, helping to ensure that surgery, such as mediastinoscopy, is only used when necessary.</p>
		<p style="font-weight: 900; font-size:20px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">What does this mean for the patient?</p>
		<p id="text">Using EBUS as a diagnostic tool provides two major benefits. Through EBUS more lymph nodes are accessible compared to mediastinoscopy. Second, the patient can potentially avoid having to undergo a more invasive surgical procedure to obtain a diagnosis. Both bring value to your practice and patient care.</p>
